# Product-Finder
This is my first project on git hub. Product Finder is a Python-based desktop application that helps users locate the availability of a specific product across nearby malls and stores. It provides a layered search experience and updates product data dynamically using a simple GUI and backend logic.

📌 Features
🔍 Search by Product Name
Users can input a product name to check its availability.

🏬 Mall Availability Check
View a list of malls where the product is available or unavailable.

🛒 Store Selection
After selecting a mall, the user can view all stores stocking the product.

📦 Detailed Product Info
Get information like store name, floor number, and availability status.

🔄 Real-time Data Updates
Product information is updated when stock is added or sold.

🚀 Future Scope
Migrating to a full-stack web version using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
Adding user authentication and admin dashboard
Moving from pickle to a scalable database (MongoDB/SQL)
